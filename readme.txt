*Sync your product listing with CodesWholesale*

Connect your store to CodesWholesale.com and import hundreds of digital products into your store. It’s fast and hassle-free!

*Error and order notifications via email*

You may want to keep an eye on what’s going on in your store, be it orders or errors. With CodesWholesale, you’re always on the right side of things!

*Low balance notifications*

If your credit goes below a certain threshold, you will receive an automatic notification. The balance check will run every time an order is fulfilled.

*Automatic order completion upon payment*

As soon as your clients pay for a game, they receive a game key via email. It travels all the way from CodesWholesale to your client, in the blink of an eye!

*Import game assets*

Without enticing product descriptions, you will not make a killer sale. That said, we bring you the quality content straight from publishers!

*Track past orders*

Want to check the details of your past orders? Get a full overview of your fulfilled orders in the Order History tab.

*New filter options*

The next time you want to import products from CodesWholesale, you’ll see the inclusion of new filters. Narrow down your search by platform, region, language, and date.

*Import products into CSV file*

OK, so you’ve applied the right filter and need to export the products to an external management system? Download them as a CSV file and you’re ready to go!

*Rate the risk of your clients’ orders*

Not all orders submitted by your clients are fully secure. How do you know that? Use CodesWholesale risk score feature and have full control over your clients’ orders.

*Download invoice in pdf*

Invoices are generated automatically for each order created via API. They are stored safely as PDF files and available on the fly!

*Get brand-new notifications via postback URL*

With the upgraded plugin, you will always get a notification for new product arrivals, products hidden from the price list or products whose details have changed.

*Double-check the price*

Always compare the price you have set with the one displayed on the price list. Otherwise, you risk losing on sales.

*Enable pre-order products*

Or disable them if you want. With this option, you are free to test demand by selling pre-order games before they are released.

*Win a customer with charm prices*

You must have heard that any price that ends in “9” compels customers to buy. From now on, the option of charm prices can be active in your Woocommerce store!

Best of all, it’s absolutely free!
